    <h2>Act 1</h2>
    <p>
      We start out with a parallel. We see the body of Teresa Banks floating down a river and then we cut to investigators
      doing their investigative work. At the same time, Laura Palmer and her best friend Donna Hayward are at school.

    <h2>Act 2</h2>
    <p>
      We start to see the role BOB plays in Laura’s life. BOB isn’t technically a physical person, but more of a spirit
      that has to find a host. BOB is mentally torturing Laura. He wants to use her as a vessel, but she won’t let him.

      Through the TV series, we already know who BOB really was, but this is where we start to see Laura figure it out.
      In a tragic scene, she finally realizes that BOB has taken over her father.
